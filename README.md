Commendation‑Certificate — Describe the generation/automation logic; note inputs/outputs and any CI used.

Hypertension‑Risk — Notebook + scripts for PCA + model comparisons; log metrics and plots; add a brief “Results” table.

Experience
Health Research Inc. — Surveillance data quality, automation, and logic design; key outcome: 25% improvement in demographic accuracy, faster weekly reporting.

NYS OMH — KPI modeling, automated ETL from PSYCKES, and decision dashboards; cross‑team handoffs with JIRA‑tracked QA.

Stats
Use minimal widgets to avoid clutter; place them after content. Swap themes to match profile palette.

![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=R4gerBOT&show_icons=true&theme=transparent&theme=transparent R4gerBOT and place this as README.md so it renders on the profile.

Pin 3–6 repos via “Customize your pins” on the profile; keep descriptions results‑oriented and align titles with resume bullets for consistency.

For each pinned repo, add grouped badges at the top and a “Results” snippet; use Shields/Badges4 and GitHub Readme Stats extra pins if needed.
